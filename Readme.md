### The JS library for when you're drinking

Here are some of the functions and their equivalents

Instead of: `document.querySelector()` You can use:`get()`

Instead of adding: `addEventListener()` To your objects you can

use:`listen(selector,eventType,callback)`

Passing your selector for your object as the
first parameter.

Instead of: `setTimeout()` You can use: `delay()`

Instead of: `setInterval()` You can use: `loop()`

Instead of: `sort()` You can use: `numberSort()` And it will automatically sort by value.

Instead of:`filter()` To filter out a single value you can use: `filterOut(array, value)` to filter out a single value.


Instead of:&emsp;`console.log(array)`&emsp;You can use:&emsp;`array.log()` replacing

array with your array variable.


Instead of:&emsp;`array.push()`&emsp;You can use:&emsp;`array.add()`


Instead of:&emsp;`array.toString()`&emsp;You can use:&emsp;`array.toWords()`

You can reverse a string just by using ```"yourString".reverse()```
